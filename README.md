<h2>How Compression Works </h2>

Compression software works by using mathematical equations to scan file data and look for repeating patterns. The software then replaces these repeating patterns with smaller pieces of data, or code, that take up less room. Once the compression software has identified a repeating pattern, it replaces that pattern with a smaller code that also shows the locations of the pattern. For example, in a picture, compression software replaces every instance of the color red with a code for red that also indicates everywhere in the picture red occurs.

<h2>Decompression </h2>

In order to use a compressed file, you must first decompress it. The software used to decompress depends on how the file was compressed in the first place. To decompress a .zip file you need software, such as WinZip. To decompress a .sit file, you need the Stuffit Expander program. WinZip does not decompress .sit files, but one version of StuffIt Expander can decompress both .zip and .sit files. Files ending in .sea or .exe are called self-extracting files. These are compressed files that do not require any special software to decompress. Just click on the file and it will automatically decompress and open.
